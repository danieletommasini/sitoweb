            <p>Sharing is not just based on searching help, but also on prevention.</p><br>
            <h4>Your code can always be improved, but in the case could not, it is a resource that can be used by everybody.</h4><br><br>

        <div style="margin-left:1%;margin-right:1%"><h1>Why doing others' work?</h1><br>
            <p>Doing something free makes no sense, but with the 99% of open source resources sharing is fundamental.</p><br>
            <h4>Correct and improve the code that will serve not only to the user who requires help but also to countless other people in the future, also to you.</h4><br><br>

            <p>Whether it is a program for college, school or work because you should not be able to help? Perhaps learning something?</p><br>
